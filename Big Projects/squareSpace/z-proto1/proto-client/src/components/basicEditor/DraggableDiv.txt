clientX is a readonly property of the MouseEvent interface. 
It provides the horizontal coordinate within the application's 
VIEWPORT at which the event occurred(as opposed to the coordinate within the page).

What if I want to check what is the position of a mouse event/ dom element relative 
to its parent dom element?


POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:
Could add a drag to bottom to scroll functionality
