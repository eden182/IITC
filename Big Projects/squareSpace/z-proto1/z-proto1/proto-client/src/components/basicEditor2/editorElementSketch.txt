lessons from basicEditor2 for basic editor 3:

need to simplify the elements and stop wrapping them in a Draggable frame, and make them draggable
instead.

each editor element should have
objectName?
componentName(so the pageRender function can create/recreate it based on its component)
position state object(so the pageRender can recreate it's location)(passed to the component)
    determines the objects state via css.
content state object(so the pageRender can recreate it's content)(passed to the component as prop)

note: json.stringify eliminates funcitons from the object as they are not considered
valid json types. I will need to add them again in the rehydration stage, or store them differently
somehow.
